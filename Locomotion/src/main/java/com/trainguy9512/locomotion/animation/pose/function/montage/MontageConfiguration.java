/**
 * Configuration for a triggerable animation, otherwise known as a Montage in Unreal Engine.
 *
 * @param identifier                        Identifier for this montage configuration.
 * @param slots                             List of slots that the montage will be reflected on during pose evaluation.
 * @param animationSequence                 Animation sequence to play
 * @param playRateFunction                  Function that provides the play rate every time a montage of this configuration is fired.
 * @param timeMarkerBindings                Bound function calls assigned to time markers.
 * @param blendMask                         Blend mask for determining which joints the montage will play on
 * @param transitionIn                      In transition timing.
 * @param transitionOut                     Out transition timing.
 * @param startTimeOffset                   The point in time the animation starts at when the montage is fired.
 * @param transitionOutCrossfadeWeight      How much the out transition cross-fades from the playing animation.
 * @param cooldownDuration                  The minimum amount of time allowed between firing montages of this configuration.
 * @param isAdditive                        Whether the montage is additive. If additive, the montage will subtract the start frame from the
 *                                          animation and then add it to the start frame of the provided additive base pose resource location.
 * @param additiveBasePoseProvider          Base pose provider added back to the additive animation.
 * @param additiveReferencePosePoint        Point in the animation sequence to use as the reference pose.
 * @param blendIntensity                    The weight in which this montage is blended into the base pose. Default is 1.
 * @param isMirrored                        Should the animation be mirrored?
